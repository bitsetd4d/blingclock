BlingClock - Visual Countdown Timer

This is the source code for BlingClock - a visual countdown timer developer and marketed 2009 - 2013. I'm releasing the source code as-is. I'm not intending any more commercial releases of BlingClock although I do plan to tinker with it. This is an example of a 'Filthy Rich' Swing Application.

I hope it's of some interest.
