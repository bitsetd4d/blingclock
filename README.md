BlingClock - Visual Countdown Timer

This is the source code for BlingClock - a visual countdown timer developer and marketed 2009 - 2013. I'm releasing the source code as-is. I'm not intending any more commercial releases of BlingClock although I do plan to tinker with it. This is an example of a 'Filthy Rich' Swing Application.

I hope it's of some interest.

_It looks absolutely GORGEOUS. And you are so right the visualizations help so much (in addition to just the digits). This is a superb piece of software, really.  Why don't more people make art instead of mere function?_

_I have been searching for a good, professional looking countdown timer and was delighted to finally find BlingClock. It is highly customizable, easy to use, 
can countdown in 1/100ths of a second and has a sleek user-interface. I have been using it for a few projects now and I am very happy with it!_

_Does everything you need it to with style!! I needed a countdown application for my guitar practice routines. I found that it was easy to get carried away in one are of my practice and other areas were getting neglected. 
So I needed some structure and BlingClock is perfect, well done guys...:-)_
